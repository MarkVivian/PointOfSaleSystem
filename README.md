# POINT OF SALE 

This project was assigned to me by some girl who rejected me (Mark Vivian Muchangi). She need it done but she didn't know how so i was the go to problem solve. Charles would be of great help but we don't don't share work load, its good for our ego.

To deploy this project backend run 

navigate to the project backend folder and run

Then navigate to the project Frontend folder and run

before running the *npm start* command make sure you have imported the database to your database engine.

## Deployment via Docker
This is the easiest way to deploy the project but apparently mark is very lasy to create a docker file and i (Charles) don't want to do it for him since i will be hurting marks   EGO
